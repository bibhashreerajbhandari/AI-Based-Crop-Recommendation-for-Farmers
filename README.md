# AI-Based-Crop-Recommendation-for-Farmers

Farmers in India often make crop selection decisions based on traditional knowledge or limited
advice, which may not align with changing soil conditions, climate patterns, or market demand. This
results in reduced productivity and financial losses. There is a need for an AI/ML-driven crop
recommendation system that analyzes parameters like soil health, weather data, water availability,
and market prices to suggest the most suitable crops for a given region and season. The solution
should be accessible to farmers in local languages via mobile applications, with offline support, and
include real-time advisory updates for sustainable farming practices.
